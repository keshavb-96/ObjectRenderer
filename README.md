# ObjectRenderer
This application uses C++ and OpenGL to render 3D objects whose vertices and faces are obtained from wavefronmt object files.
The program only accepts inputs of object files which contain only vertex and face information. Normals are then calculated based 
on the vertex postions.

This is a command line application. The path of the wavefront object file must be passed as the only argument.

The folder ObjectFiles contains some sample wavefront Object Files.
